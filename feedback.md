# Feedback for Avail Project (Blockchain Data Availability)

## 1. Auto-Generation of Configuration Files  
In the `avail-nitro-contracts` repository, please ensure that `nodeConfig.json` and `orbitSetupScriptConfig.json` are **automatically generated** after deploying the base contracts. This will streamline the setup process, reducing manual configuration and the risk of errors.  

## 2. Cloud Deployment Documentation  
The current documentation only provides instructions for deploying the rollup locally. Please extend it to include **deployment guides for cloud platforms like AWS**. This will help developers transition to production environments more easily and improve scalability options.

## 3. Encountering Issues During Arbitrum Nitro Deployment with Foundry

During the Arbitrum Nitro deployment process, I encountered some issues while running the following command:

```bash
$ yarn build:forge:yul
```

For reference, you can check the official Avail documentation on building with the Optimium stack for Arbitrum Nitro:
